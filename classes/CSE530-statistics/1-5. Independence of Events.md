+ The event $A$ is ***independent*** on the event $B$ if knowledge about the occurrence of event $B$ doesn't alter the probability of event $A$. $$P(A|B)=P(A)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)} \rightarrow P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B)$$
+ If the events have non-zero probabilities & mutually exclusive ==> cannot be independent!
    - Mutually Exclusive <=> $P(A\cap B)=0$
    - Independence <=> $P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B)$

- Q. From the example 'Communication system', what's the condition of independence of $A$ & $B$ ?




- Extension to a set of $n$ events. $$for\, k=2,3,...n,\; P(A_{i1}\cap A_{i2}\cap ...\cap A_{ik}\cap)=P(A_{i1})P(A_{i2})...P(A_{ik})\; where\, 1\leq i_1\leq ... \leq i_k \leq n $$
