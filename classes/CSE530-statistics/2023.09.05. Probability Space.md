`random experiment` 
  - outcome varies in an unpredictable fashion when it is repeated under the same conditions
  - specified by a procedure & one or more observation. 
    (ex1. toss a dice & the # of dots)
    (ex2. toss a dice & whether the # of dots is odd or even)

`probability space` : a specific measure space
  - *(Sample space $\Omega$ , $Field$, $Probability Measure$)
  - cf) measure space = $[X, A, \mu]$ ($X$: set, $A$: $\sigma$-algebra, $\mu$: observation in $(X,A)$)
	    ex) $X=\{0,1\}, A=P(X)=\{\emptyset, \{0\}, \{1\}, \{0,1\}\},$ 
	           $\mu\{\{0\}\}=\mu\{\{1\}\}=1/2$,  $\mu\{\emptyset\}=0$, $\mu\{X\}=1$ 
  - A field $F$ in the probability space is nonempty class in which is closed under complementation and finite unions.
	  1. $\Omega \in F$
	  2. If $A \in F$ --> $A^c \in F$
	  3. If $A_i \in F$ --> $\cup_{i=1}^{n}A_i \in F$ 
  - $F$ is a $\sigma-field$ is closed under countable unions ($n$-->$\infty$)
  - $Event$ is a subset of $\Omega$, which has been assigned a specific probability.
