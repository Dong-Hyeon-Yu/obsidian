- a specific measure space
- **measurable space**: (Sample space $\Omega$ , Field $\mathbb{F}$)
- **Probability space**: (Sample space $\Omega$ , Field $\mathbb{F}$, Probability Measure $P$)


### (1) Sample space
- possilble outcomes of a random experiment.
- $Event$ is a subset of $\Omega$, which has been assigned a specific probability. 


### (2) Field
- A field $\mathbb{F}$ in the probability space is nonempty class in which is closed under complementation and finite unions.
	  1. $\Omega \in \mathbb{F}$
	  2. If $A \in \mathbb{F}$ --> $A^c \in \mathbb{F}$
	  3. If $A_i \in \mathbb{F}$ --> $\cup_{i=1}^{n}A_i \in \mathbb{F}$ 
- $\mathbb{F}$ is a $\sigma-field$ is closed under countable unions ($n$-->$\infty$)
  (i.e.) 
    Q: is A $\sigma-field$? ($A$: {all intervals of the form $[x, b]$})
	A: $\cup_{n=1}^\infty [1/n, b]=(0,b] \notin A$
