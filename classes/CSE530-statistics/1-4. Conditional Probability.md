- $P(A|B)$ is a conditional probability of event $A$ when event $B$ has occurred.
- $P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$ 
  <==> $P(A\cap B)=P(A|B)P(B)=P(B|A)P(A)$ 


- **Total Probability**
  : Let $B_1, B_2, ..., B_n$ be mutually exclusive events whose union is the sample space $\Omega$. 
  $$A=A\cap \Omega=A\cap(B_1\cup B_2\cup...\cup B_n)$$
  By the probability property, $$P(A)=P(A\cap B_1)+P(A\cap B_2)+...+P(A\cap B_n)$$


- **Bayes' Rule**
  : Let $B_1, B_2, ..., B_n$ be partition of a sample space $\Omega$. What is the probability of event $B_j$ if event $A$ has been occurred?
   ($A$ : observable information / $B_j$ : non-observable information.)
  $$P(B_j|A)=\frac{P(B_j\cap A)}{P(A)}$$
  by total probability theorem, $$P(B_j|A)=\frac{P(B_j\cap A)}{P(A)}=\frac{P(B_j\cap A)}{\sum_1^nP(A|B_k)P(B_k)}$$
  **\*Remarks:**
   1) the priori probability $P(B_j)$ are probabilities of events before the experiment is performed.
   2) suppose that ans experiment is performed and $A$ comes. -> the posteriori probabilities are the probabilities of the events in the partition $P(B_j|A)$.
