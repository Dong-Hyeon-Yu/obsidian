## GlassDB: An Efficient Verifiable Ledger Database System Through Transparency

VLDB '23

goal -> build a practical verifable ledger database system (`transparency log`)

Three challenges
1. lack of unified framework for comparing verifiable ledger databases
	- establish a design space: (abstraction dimension / thread model dimension / performance dimension)
	- propose a benchmark with extended workload from YCSB and TPC-C
2. ??
3. ??

GlassDB (p10)
- efficient proof sizes: two-level Merkle-like tree
- auditing and user gossiping for security
- efficient state lookup
- partition data over multiple nodes --> each node maintains a separate ledger?

Verifiable ledger databases
- OLTP query: read or update
- proof: append-only history log

Q. (15p) it seems that only the db cluster has data. 
Q. what if auditors are not honest?
Q. 2PC??
